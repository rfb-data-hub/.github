This GitHub organization is part of the Flow Battery Commons, a global research community dedicated to the topic of flow batteries. Initiated by scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Queenâ€™s University Belfast (QUB), and Friedrich Schiller University Jena (FSU), this community welcomes individuals with an interest in flow battery research and development. Feel free to participate actively in this community and help to shape it! We also would appreciate if you invite colleagues that can benefit from or contribute to this space! 

## Flow Battery Commons Discord

The Discord server is the primary communication platform of this community. We recommend to create a Discord account and simply join the server via the badge above or [by clicking here](https://discord.gg/tPPTtVUB).

Members will be vetted according to the application by Moderators. Generally, we seek folks who are actively engaged in flow battery research and/or contribute to this community. University / industry emails will help in the vetting process.

## Flow Battery Commons Hub

The Flow Battery Commons data hub, managed as a Github organization, will host public repositories. We aim to make it the primary storage location for public flow battery community data, simplifying the discovery of new tools and open-access data tailored to the community. The hub will include various repositories with data collections (e.g., open-source cell designs), community-developed tools (e.g., Python scripts for data analyses), community-managed documents using Manubot, raw data for publications, and other community-beneficial resources.

If you would like to contribute to this data hub (e.g., by storing your publication's raw data here), please feel free to ask for an invite to this organization on our Discord server.
